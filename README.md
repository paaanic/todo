### todo
Simple Django project written in templates based style for studying purposes. It's quite common todo but with several complications, which are: 
- friendships - for handling users being friends;
- avatars - adds the ability to have an avatar (thanks to [py-avataaars](https://github.com/kebu/py-avataaars));
- notifications - a skeleton of a service for notifications about tasks expiration;

Styling done with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
